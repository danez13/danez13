## 👋 Hey I am Daniel Hernandez
I'm a computer science student who is passionate about many things including but not limited to technology, learning, and community-building. As the Vice-president and tech lead of Code Crunch Club, I empower students to excel in technical interview preparation, Datascience/AI, and software development by fostering an inclusive and collaborative environment. Dive into my journey of coding, leadership, and community service!

### 🚀 Fun fact:
I like to listen to people. to learn from what they have to say, to learn from their mistakes, and to learn from their triumphs. 

```“Wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it.” — Albert Einstein```
